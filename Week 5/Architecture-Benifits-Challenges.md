## Introduction to Big Data

Big Data refers to massive and complex datasets (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured) generated from multiple sources such as applications, sensors, devices, social media, and enterprise systems.

Traditional database systems cannot efficiently process this scale of data, which led to the development of distributed architectures.

## Big Data Architecture

A Big Data architecture is designed to handle:

- Data ingestion
- Data storage
- Data processing
- Data analysis
- Reporting and visualization

It supports data that is too large or complex for traditional systems.
