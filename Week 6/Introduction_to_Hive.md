## Understanding the Components

Before comparing, it is important to clarify the roles:

- **Hadoop** is an ecosystem for distributed storage and processing.
- **MapReduce** is Hadoop’s original processing model.
- **Spark** is a separate distributed data processing engine that can run independently or on Hadoop (via YARN).

Hadoop includes:
- HDFS (Storage)
- YARN (Resource Management)
- MapReduce (Processing)

Spark can:
- Run on YARN
- Use HDFS for storage
- Replace MapReduce as a processing engine

# Key Differences

## 1. Speed

### Apache Spark
- Processes data in memory.
- Up to 100× faster in-memory.
- Around 10× faster on disk compared to MapReduce.
- Reduces disk read/write cycles.

### Hadoop MapReduce
- Disk-based processing.
- Writes intermediate data to disk.
- Slower due to repeated disk I/O.

---

## 2. Ease of Use

### Apache Spark
- Provides high-level APIs.
- Supports Scala, Python, Java, and R.
- Uses RDDs and DataFrames.
- Supports interactive processing.

### Hadoop MapReduce
- Requires writing Map and Reduce logic manually.
- More boilerplate code.
- No interactive mode.
- More complex development.

---

## 3. Latency

### Apache Spark
- Low latency.
- Suitable for real-time and interactive analytics.

### Hadoop MapReduce
- High latency.
- Designed primarily for batch processing.

---

## 4. Data Processing Capabilities

### Apache Spark
Supports:
- Batch processing
- Streaming
- Machine learning
- Graph processing
- Interactive SQL

### Hadoop MapReduce
Supports:
- Batch processing only

---

## 5. Failure Recovery

### Hadoop MapReduce
- Strong fault tolerance.
- Resumes failed tasks automatically.
- Based on disk-based checkpoints.

### Apache Spark
- Fault tolerance via lineage (RDD).
- Recomputes lost partitions.
- Efficient but memory-heavy workloads may require tuning.

---

## 6. Cost Consideration

### Hadoop MapReduce
- Requires less memory.
- Lower hardware cost.
- Suitable for budget-constrained batch workloads.

### Apache Spark
- Memory-intensive.
- Requires higher RAM.
- Higher infrastructure cost.

---

## 7. Security

Both integrate with Hadoop ecosystem security:

- Kerberos authentication
- HDFS permissions
- YARN-based access control

Security depends on configuration rather than framework default.

## Hadoop MapReduce Use Case

Imagine you have 10 large datasets (bags of data).  
Each mapper processes one dataset in parallel.  
The reducer aggregates the results.

Used for:
- Daily ETL jobs
- Log aggregation
- Data warehousing batch tasks

Industries:
- Banking
- Telecom
- Government archives

---

## Apache Spark Use Case

Spark is used when real-time speed matters.

Example:
- Real-time fraud detection
- Recommendation systems
- Live dashboard analytics
- Streaming analytics

Industries:
- E-commerce
- FinTech
- Media platforms
- Machine learning pipelines

---

## When to Choose What?

Choose MapReduce when:
- Processing large historical batch datasets
- Budget constraints exist
- Simpler batch pipeline required

Choose Spark when:
- Low latency is required
- Machine learning needed
- Interactive analytics required
- Real-time streaming required

<details><summary>Implementation</summary>

## 1️⃣ Hadoop MapReduce (Python via Hadoop Streaming)

### Mapper (mapper.py)

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    words = line.strip().split()
    for word in words:
        print(f"{word}\t1")
```

### Reducer (reducer.py)

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def read_mapper_output(file, separator='\t'):
    for line in file:
        yield line.rstrip().split(separator, 1)

data = read_mapper_output(sys.stdin)

for current_word, group in groupby(data, itemgetter(0)):
    try:
        total_count = sum(int(count) for _, count in group)
        print(f"{current_word}\t{total_count}")
    except ValueError:
        pass
```

### Execution

``` bash
hadoop jar hadoop-streaming.jar \
-input input.txt \
-output output \
-mapper mapper.py \
-reducer reducer.py
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ Apache Spark (PySpark)

``` python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("WordCount").getOrCreate()

text_file = spark.read.text("input.txt")

words = text_file.rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.value.split())

word_counts = words.map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

word_counts.saveAsTextFile("output")

spark.stop()
```

### Execution

``` bash
spark-submit wordcount.py
